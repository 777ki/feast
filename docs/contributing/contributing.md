# Contribution Process

We use [RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/gojek/feast/issues) to communicate development ideas. The simplest way to contribute to Feast is to leave comments in our [RFCs](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Lj1nIeRB868oZvKTPLYqAvKQ4O0BksjY) in the [Feast Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AAe8j7ZK3sxSUk9PVA) or our GitHub issues.

Please communicate your ideas through a GitHub issue or through our Slack Channel before starting development.

Please [submit a PR ](https://github.com/gojek/feast/pulls)to the master branch of the Feast repository once you are ready to submit your contribution. Code submission to Feast \(including submission from project maintainers\) require review and approval from maintainers or code owners.

PRs that are submitted by the general public need to be identified as `ok-to-test`. Once enabled, [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow) will run a range of tests to verify the submission, after which community members will help to review the pull request.
